# COMPUTE AND MAP THE SHORTEST DRIVING DISTANCE IN R

This repo will show you how to effortlessly compute and map the shortest driving distance from a locality to any object using R

In this repo, I explore the competitive position of petrol stations using the case of Belgrade (Serbia). I calculate the shortest driving distance from every Belgrade locality to a petrol station using package (dodgr)[https://github.com/ATFutures/dodgr] to compute the double-weighted driving distance from the centroid of every census locality in Belgrade to the nearest petrol station via highway.

This repo will equip you with the skills necessary to conduct your own competition analysis on, for example, food and grocery retail, sport and entertainment or the hospitality industry. Such GeoBI report could ultimately help your clients gain a competitive advantage in their respective industries.

I use OpenStreetMaps data to fetch the roads and petroleum stations in Belgrade as well as the 2021 official Serbian census boundary [data](https://github.com/justinelliotmeyers/Official_Serbia_2021_Administrative_Boundaries).
